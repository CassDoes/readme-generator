  ## Description
  This project was designed to create README files for future projects without the need to generate and format new Markdown with each newly created repository.

  ## Installation
  To use this project to generate your own README files, you'll need to clone this repository and install the required dependencies (npm inquirer). You can then access project from your command line.

  ## Usage
  Every repository needs a complete and detailed README. This project makes generating a new README quick by using command line prompts to autofill an already formatted and styled Javascript file which then transfers all newly created input into a newly created README.md
